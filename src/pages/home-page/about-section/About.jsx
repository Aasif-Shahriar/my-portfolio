              Hi, I'm Asif Azad â€” a passionate MERN Stack Developer with a knack
              for building clean, responsive, and interactive web applications.
              From managing user-friendly interfaces to handling secure backend
              logic, I love solving real-world problems through code.
            </p>
            <p>
              With expertise across the full development stack, I create
              seamless digital experiences that not only look great but perform
              exceptionally. My approach combines technical precision with
              creative problem-solving to deliver applications that truly make a
              difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies,
              contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with
              the developer community.
            </p>
